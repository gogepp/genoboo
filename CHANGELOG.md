## [0.4.10] 2023-11-29

### Added

- Added 'annotation_field" config option, for external ES search
- Added redirection from Gene subentity to Gene in url


## [0.4.10] 2023-11-23

### Added

- Added 'disable_header' config option, to hide GeneNotebook links and display on the landing page

### Fixed

- Fixed test CI
- Fixed gene list not re-rendering properly when searching
- Fixed search block on the bottom of the landing page

## [0.4.9] 2023-11-17

### Fixed

- Error management in expression files

## [0.4.8] 2023-10-20

### Added

- Option for redirecting the search to an external url ("public.redirectSearch" key in config)
  - An additional key "public.redirectSearchAttribute", defaulting to 'query', will be used as the get parameter attribute. (ie: url + "?redirectSearchAttribute=query")
- Options for using a remote search ending, and merging the results with GNB internal search.
  - The 'public.externalSearch' option need to be set to true, and an 'externalSearchOptions' dict need to be set.
  - 'url' key is the remote endpoint where the query will be sent
  - 'gene_field' is the remote field to get the gene IDs (default to geneId)
  - 'query_param' : optional get parameter to use for the query
  - 'field_param': optional get parameter to use to restrict the results to the gene_field value
  - 'count_param': optional get parameter to restrict the number of results
- Multiple annotations for the same genome
  - When adding an annotation, you must now set the '--annot' to set the annotation name.
  - When integrating data afterward, you can use the --annot tag to specify the annotation you are aiming for.
  - If you have multiple genes with the same ID, and do not specify '--annot', the results may be variables
  - You can specify --annotations multiple time when integrating orthogroups
- Will now decode proteins and genes IDs when integrating data. (It was already done when integrating gffs, so there was some mismatch with IDs)
